# Probability-Functions

During my fall semester in 2020, I was taking an Engineering Probability class and wanted to apply concepts from one chapter into a program that reinforces my knowledge of probability functions such as:

- Bernoulli
- Exponential
- Uniform
- Poisson
- Conditional

The bulk of this program describes the probability for an event to occur with specific parameters set in each function.
For every type of probability function, a density and distribution function is included as a public member function in the derived class.
